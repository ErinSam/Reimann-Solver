# [The Exact Reimann Solver ](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Exact%20Reimann%20Solver)
Provides an exact solution for a Reimann Problem given the density, velocity and pressure of the driver and driven regions. 

# [Godunov's Method](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method)
Using Godunov's method to solve:
1. [Euler's Equations](), 
2. [System of linear hyperbolic PDEs](https://github.com/ErinSam/ReimannSolver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method/Godunov%20Method%20on%20System%20of%20Linear%2C%20Hyperbolic%20Equations) and,
3. a [Single linear hyperbolic PDE](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method/Godunov%20Method%20on%20a%20Single%2C%20Linear%2C%20Hyperbolic%20Equation).
