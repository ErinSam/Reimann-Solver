# [The Exact Reimann Solver ](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Exact%20Reimann%20Solver)
Provides an exact solution for a Reimann Problem given the density, velocity and pressure of the driver and driven regions. 

# [Godunov's Scheme](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method)
Contains scripts to solve the following using Godunov's scheme. 
1. [Euler's Equations](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method/Godunov%20Method%20on%20System%20of%20Non-Linear%2C%20Hyperbolic%20Equations),<br />
  Working script: v2.2<br />
  This script uses Godunov's method in conjunction with the exact reimann solver. <br />
  A new version of this script, decoupled from the exact reimann sovlver shall be soon released. This can then be used with other reimann solvers. 
2. [System of linear hyperbolic PDEs](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method/Godunov%20Method%20on%20System%20of%20Linear%2C%20Hyperbolic%20Equations) and,
3. a [Single linear hyperbolic PDE](https://github.com/ErinSam/Reimann-Solver/tree/main/Godunov's%20Method/Godunov%20Method%20on%20a%20Single%2C%20Linear%2C%20Hyperbolic%20Equation).
